    man-pages-1.7.tar.gz - section 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 man pages for Linux



Differences from version 1.6:
    
    The following files have been updated:

	getdents.2 gethostname.2 gettimeofday.2 modify_ldt.2 mprotect.2
	obsolete.2 profil.2 readdir.2 swapon.2 undocumented.2

	exit.3 malloc.3 mktemp.3

	passwd.5

	ascii.7 iso_8859_1.7 mailaddr.7



Here is a breakdown of what this distribution contains:

    Section 1 = user commands (intro only)
    Section 2 = system calls
    Section 3 = libc calls
    Section 4 = devices (e.g., hd, sd)
    Section 5 = file formats (e.g., wtmp, /etc/passwd)
    Section 6 = games (intro only)
    Section 7 = macro packages, etc. (e.g., nroff, ascii)
    Section 8 = system administration (intro only)
    Section 9 = internal kernel routines (for kernel hackers)

    (There are no section 1, 6 and 8 man pages because these should be
    distributed with the binaries they are written for.)

    Note that only Section 2 is really complete, but Section 3 contains
    several hundred man pages.  I have included all completed man pages in
    this distribution to give people an idea of what is available.  If you
    want to write some man pages, please join the linux-doc mailing list on
    the vger.rutgers.edu server.



To install this distribution, do something like:

    cd /usr/man; zcat man-pages-1.7.tar.gz | tar xvpf -
