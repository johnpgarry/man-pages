    man-pages-1.3.tar.gz - section 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, and 9 man pages for Linux

Differences from version 1.2:
    Lots of bugs fixed by Jens Schweikhardt (The Typo Terminator):
        man3/fget3.c  renamed to man3/fgetc.3
        Fixed some .so problems (getnetbyname and friends)
        About a dozen cases of word doubling corrected
        About half a dozen semantic typos corrected
        Ran all files through ispell and corrected >200 spelling typos
        (If you ever write a man page, use ispell, I mean it!)
        Explicitly tested all files whether they run through groff
        Hard linked identical files (the ones with just .so foo/bar.1) thus
        saving 115 disk blocks and 115 inodes.

Differences from version 1.0:
    Thanks to Giorgio Ciucci for the following *NEW* man pages:
        msgctl.2        msgrcv.2        semget.2        shmdt.2
        msgget.2        msgsnd.2        semop.2         ipc.5
        msgop.2         semctl.2        shmat.2         ftok.3
    and for updates to shmctl.2, shmget.2, and shmop.2.

    Michael Haardt pointed out that some general formatting problems needed
    fixing:
            Multi-word arguments to .SH are now in quotes
            Many instances of - (hyphen) were changed to \- (minus)
            Several instances of \- (minus) were changed to \(em (dash)

    shells.5 updated (thanks to Michael Haardt)
    gethostid.2 updated (thanks for Mitchum DSouza)
    Minor updates to write.2, man.7, and a few other man pages.
    Fully converted BSD man pages for:
        all of the stdio functions (includes printf and scanf)
        alloca, popen, stdarg, and exec


Here is a breakdown of what this distribution contains:

Section 1 = user commands (intro only)
Section 2 = system calls
Section 3 = libc calls
Section 4 = devices (e.g., hd, sd)
Section 5 = file formats (e.g., wtmp, /etc/passwd)
Section 6 = games (intro only)
Section 7 = macro packages, etc. (e.g., nroff, ascii)
Section 8 = system administration (intro only)
Section 9 = internal kernel routines (for kernel hackers)

(There are no section 1, 6 and 8 man pages because these should be
distributed with the binaries they are written for.)

Note that only Section 2 is really complete, but Section 3 contains several
hundred man pages.  I have included all completed man pages in this
distribution to give people an idea of what is available.  If you want to
write some man pages, please join the linux-activists DOC channel.

To install this distribution, do something like:

    cd /usr/man; zcat man-pages-1.2.tar.gz | tar xvpf -
