.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
The \fIisgreater\fP() macro shall determine whether its first argument
is greater than its second argument. The value of
\fIisgreater\fP( \fIx\fP, \fIy\fP) shall be equal to (\fIx\fP)\0>\0(\fIy\fP);
however, unlike
(\fIx\fP)\0>\0(\fIy\fP), \fIisgreater\fP( \fIx\fP, \fIy\fP) shall
not raise the invalid floating-point exception
when \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP are unordered.
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, the \fIisgreater\fP() macro shall return
the value of (\fIx\fP)\0>\0(\fIy\fP).
.LP
If \fIx\fP or \fIy\fP is NaN, 0 shall be returned.
.SH ERRORS
.LP
No errors are defined.

.SH EXAMPLES

None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
The relational and equality operators support the usual mathematical
relationships between numeric values. For any ordered pair
of numeric values, exactly one of the relationships (less, greater,
and equal) is true. Relational operators may raise the invalid
floating-point exception when argument values are NaNs. For a NaN
and a numeric value, or for two NaNs, just the unordered
relationship is true. This macro is a quiet (non-floating-point exception
raising) version of a relational operator. It facilitates
writing efficient code that accounts for NaNs without suffering the
invalid floating-point exception. In the SYNOPSIS section,
\fBreal-floating\fP indicates that the argument shall be an expression
of \fBreal-floating\fP type.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
