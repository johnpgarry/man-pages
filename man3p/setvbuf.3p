.SH NAME
setvbuf - assign buffering to a stream
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
\fB#include <stdio.h>
.br
.sp
int setvbuf(FILE *restrict\fP \fIstream\fP\fB, char *restrict\fP \fIbuf\fP\fB,
int\fP \fItype\fP\fB,
.br
\0\0\0\0\0\0 size_t\fP \fIsize\fP\fB);

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
the ISO\0C standard. Any conflict between the
requirements described here and the ISO\0C standard is unintentional.
This volume of IEEE\0Std\01003.1-2001 defers to
the ISO\0C standard. 
.LP
The \fIsetvbuf\fP() function may be used after the stream pointed
to by \fIstream\fP is associated with an open file but
before any other operation (other than an unsuccessful call to \fIsetvbuf\fP())
is performed on the stream. The argument
\fItype\fP determines how \fIstream\fP shall be buffered, as follows:
.RS
.in +5
.LP
{_IOFBF} shall cause input/output to be fully buffered.
.in -5
.in +5
.LP
{_IOLBF} shall cause input/output to be line buffered.
.in -5
.in +5
.LP
{_IONBF} shall cause input/output to be unbuffered.
.in -5
.RE
.LP
If \fIbuf\fP is not a null pointer, the array it points to may be
used instead of a buffer allocated by \fIsetvbuf\fP() and
the argument \fIsize\fP specifies the size of the array; otherwise,
\fIsize\fP may determine the size of a buffer allocated by
the \fIsetvbuf\fP() function. The contents of the array at any time
are unspecified.
.LP
For information about streams, see \fIStandard I/O Streams\fP .
.SH RETURN VALUE
.LP
Upon successful completion, \fIsetvbuf\fP() shall return 0. Otherwise,
it shall return a non-zero value if an invalid value is
given for \fItype\fP or if the request cannot be honored,   \0and
may set \fIerrno\fP to indicate the error. 
.SH ERRORS
.LP
The \fIsetvbuf\fP() function may fail if:
.TP
.B EBADF
The file descriptor underlying \fIstream\fP is not valid. 
.sp
.LP
\fIThe following sections are informative.\fP
.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
None.
.SH APPLICATION USAGE
.LP
A common source of error is allocating buffer space as an "automatic"
variable in a code block, and then failing to close the
stream in the same block.
.LP
With \fIsetvbuf\fP(), allocating a buffer of \fIsize\fP bytes does
not necessarily imply that all of \fIsize\fP bytes are
used for the buffer area.
.LP
Applications should note that many implementations only provide line
buffering on input from terminal devices.
.SH RATIONALE
.LP
None.
.SH FUTURE DIRECTIONS
.LP
None.
