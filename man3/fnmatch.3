.TH FNMATCH 3  "April 19, 1993" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
fnmatch \- match filename or pathname
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <fnmatch.h>
.sp
.BI "int fnmatch(const char *" "pattern" ", const char *" strings ", int "flags ");"
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B fnmatch()
checks the
.I strings
argument and checks if it matches
.I pattern
argument, which is a shell wildcard pattern.
.PP
The
.I flags
argument modifies the behaviour; it is the bitwise OR of zero or more
of the following flags:
.TP
.B FNM_NOESCAPE
If this flag is set, treat backslash as an ordinary charachter,
instead of an escape charachter.
.TP
.B FNM_PATHNAME
If this flag is set, match a slash in
.I string
only with a slash in
.I pattern
and not, for example, with a [] \- sequence containting a slash.
.TP
.B FNM_PERIOD
If flag this is set, a leading period in
.I string
has to be matched exactly by a period in
.IR pattern .
A period is considered to be leading if it is the first character in
.IR string ,
or if both
.B FNM_PATHNAME 
is set and the period immediately follows a slash.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Zero if
.I string
matches
.IR pattern ,
.B FNM_NOMATCH
if there is no match or another value if there is an error.
