.TH GETGRNAM 3  1993-04-04 "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
getgrnam, getgrgid \- get group file entry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <grp.h>
.B #include <sys/types.h>
.sp
.BI "struct group *getgrnam(const char *" name );
.sp
.BI "struct group *getgrgid(gid_t " gid );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBgetgrnam()\fP function returns a pointer to a structure containing
the group information from \fI/etc/group\fP for the entry that matches
the group name \fIname\fP.
.PP
The \fBgetgrgid()\fP function returns a pointer to a structure containing
the group information from \fI/etc/group\fP for the entry that matches
the group gid \fIgid\fP.
.PP
The \fIgroup\fP structure is defined in \fI<grp.h>\fP as follows:
.sp
.RS
.nf
.ta 8n 16n 32n
struct group {
        char    *gr_name;        /* group name */
        char    *gr_passwd;      /* group password */
        gid_t   gr_gid;          /* group id */
        char    **gr_mem;        /* group members */
};
.ta
.fi
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBgetgrnam()\fP and \fBgetgrgid()\fP functions return a pointer
to the group information structure, or NULL if the matching entry
is not found or an error occurs. If an error occurs,
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.LP
The return value may point to static area, and may be overwritten
by subsequent calls.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.BR 0 " or " ENOENT " or " ESRCH " or " EBADF " or " EPERM " or ... "
The given
.I name
or
.I gid
was not found.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient memory.
.\" to allocate the group structure, or to allocate buffers
.TP
.B EIO
I/O error.
.TP
.B EINTR
A signal was caught.
.TP
.B EMFILE
The maximum number (OPEN_MAX) of files was open already in the calling process.
.TP
.B ENFILE
The maximum number of files was open already in the system.
.SH FILES
.TP
.I /etc/group
Group database file
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, POSIX, BSD 4.3
.SH NOTES
The formulation given above under "RETURN VALUE" is from POSIX.1-2001.
It does not call "not found" an error, hence does not specify what value
.I errno
might have in this situation. But that makes it impossible to recognize
errors. One might argue that according to POSIX
.I errno
should be left unchanged if an entry is not found. Experiments on various
Unix-like systems shows that lots of different values occur in this
situation: 0, ENOENT, EBADF, ESRCH, EWOULDBLOCK, EPERM and probably others.
.\" more precisely:
.\" AIX 5.1 - gives ESRCH
.\" OSF1 4.0g - gives EWOULDBLOCK
.\" libc, glibc, Irix 6.5 - give ENOENT
.\" FreeBSD 4.8, OpenBSD 3.2, NetBSD 1.6 - give EPERM
.\" SunOS 5.8 - gives EBADF
.\" Tru64 5.1b, HP-UX-11i, SunOS 5.7 - give 0
