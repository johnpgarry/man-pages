.SH NAME
bsearch \- binary search of a sorted array.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.RS
.BI "size_t " size ", int (*" compar ")(const void *, const void *));

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBbsearch()\fP function searches an array of \fInmemb\fP objects,
the initial member of which is pointed to by \fIbase\fP, for a member
that matches the object pointed to by \fIkey\fP.  The size of each member
of the array is specified by \fIsize\fP.
.PP
The contents of the array should be in ascending sorted order according
to the comparison function referenced by \fIcompar\fP.  The \fIcompar\fP
routine is expected to have two arguments which point to the \fIkey\fP
object and to an array member, in that order, and should return an integer
less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the \fIkey\fP object is found,
respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than the array
member.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBbsearch()\fP function returns a pointer to a matching member of the
array, or NULL if no match is found.  If there are multiple elements that 
match the key, the element returned is unspecified.
