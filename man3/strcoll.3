.TH STRCOLL 3  "April 12, 1993" "GNU" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
strcoll \- compare two strings using the current locale
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <string.h>
.sp
.BI "int strcoll(const char *" s1 ", const char *" s2 );
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBstrcoll()\fP function compares the two strings \fIs1\fP and
\fIs2\fP.  It returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater 
than zero if \fIs1\fP is found, respectively, to be less than, 
to match, or be greater than \fIs2\fP.  The comparison is based on
strings interpreted as appropriate for the program's current locale 
for category \fILC_COLLATE\fP.  (See \fBsetlocale\fP(3)).
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
The \fBstrcoll()\fP function returns an integer less than, equal to, 
or greater than zero if \fIs1\fP is found, respectively, to be less 
than, to match, or be greater than \fIs2\fP, when both are interpreted
as appropriate for the current locale.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
SVID 3, BSD 4.3, ISO 9899
.SH NOTES
The Linux C Library currently only understands the \fI"C"\fP or
\fI"POSIX"\fP locales in which \fBstrcoll()\fP is equivalent to
\fBstrcmp()\fP.
