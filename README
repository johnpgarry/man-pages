This package contains the Linux man pages for all chapters
except 1, 6 and 8. Some more information is given in the
`Announce' file.

Install by copying to your favourite location.
"make install" will just copy them to /usr/share/man/man[1-8].
"make" will move the pages from this package that are older than
the already installed ones to a subdirectory `not_installed',
then remove old versions (compressed or not),
compress the pages, and copy them to /usr/share/man/man[1-8].


Note that you may have to remove preformatted pages.

Note that sometimes these pages are duplicates of pages
also distributed in other packages. This has been reported
about dlclose.3, dlerror.3, dlopen.3, dlsym.3 (found in ld.so),
about resolver.3, resolv.conf.5 (found in bind-utils),
and about passwd.5, and mailaddr.7. Be careful not to
overwrite more up-to-date versions.
Reports on further duplicates are welcome.
Formerly present and now removed duplicates:
 *_module.2, get_kernel_syms.2 (found in modutils-2.1.*),
 exports.5 (found in nfs-server-2.2*),
 fstab.5, nfs.5 (found in util-linux-2.12*),
 lilo.8, lilo.conf.5 (found in lilo-21.6*).

Note that the pages that come with GNU fileutils are really
help texts (indeed, are generated automatically from help texts),
and worse than worthless. Without them people would have good
detailed man pages, such as those found here in man1.
As it is, many distributions install these "man pages",
to the detriment of their users.

Copyrights: These man pages come under various copyrights.
For the POSIX pages, see the file POSIX-COPYRIGHT.
All other pages are freely distributable when the nroff source is included.

Send corrections and additions to mtk-manpages@gmx.net
(man.7 has some info on the macros to use).
