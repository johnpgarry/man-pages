This package contains the Linux man pages for all chapters
except 1 and 8. Some more information is given in the
`Announce' file.

Install by copying to your favourite location.
"make install" will copy them to /usr/man/man[1-8].

If your man pager can handle compressed source pages
(man-1.4 can), you might do "make gz" before "make install".

Copyrights: These man pages come under various copyrights.
All are freely distributable when the nroff source is included.
