This package contains the Linux man pages for all chapters
except 1, 6 and 8. Some more information is given in the
`Announce' file.

Install by copying to your favourite location.
"make install" will just copy them to /usr/man/man[1-8].
"make" will move the pages from this package that are older than
the already installed ones to a subdirectory `not_installed',
then remove old versions (compressed or not),
compress the pages, and copy them to /usr/man/man[1-8].


Note that you may have to remove preformatted pages.

Note that sometimes these pages are duplicates of pages
also distributed in other packages. This has been reported
about *_module.2, exports.5, fstab.5, nfs.5, passwd.5 and
mailaddr.7. Be careful not to overwrite more up-to-date versions.
(Probably I'll remove these pages one of these days.
Reports on further duplicates are welcome.)

Copyrights: These man pages come under various copyrights.
All are freely distributable when the nroff source is included.
