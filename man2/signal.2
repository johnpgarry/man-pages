.SH NAME
signal \- ANSI C signal handling.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <signal.h>
.sp 2
.BI "void (*signal(int " signum ", void (*" handler ")(int)))(int);"

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B signal
system call installs a new signal handler for the signal with number
.I signum.
The signal handler is set to
.I handler
which may be a user specified function, or one of the following:
.RS
.TP
.B SIG_IGN
Ignore the signal.
.TP
.B SIG_DFL
Reset the signal to its default behavior.
.RE
.PP

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.B signal
returns the previous value of the signal handler, or
.B SIG_ERR
on error.

.SH NOTES
Signal handlers cannot be set for
.B SIGKILL
or
.BR SIGSTOP .
.PP
Unlike BSD systems, signals under Linux are reset to their default
behavior when raised.
.PP
If you're confused by the prototype at the top of this manpage, it
may help to see it separated out thus:
.PP
typedef void (*sighandler_t)(int);
.br
.BI "sighandler_t signal(int " signum ", sighandler_t " handler );

.SH "CONFORMING TO"
ANSI C
