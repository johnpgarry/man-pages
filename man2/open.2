.SH DESCRIPTION
.B open
attempts to open a file and return a file descriptor (a small,
non-negative integer for use in
.BR read ", " write ", etc.)"

.I flags
is one of
.BR O_RDONLY ", " O_WRONLY " or " O_RDWR
which request opening the file read-only, write-only or read/write,
respectively.

.I flags
may also be
.RI bitwise- or 'd
with one or more of the following:
.TP
.B O_CREAT
If the file does not exist it will be created.
.TP
.B O_EXCL
When used with
.BR O_CREAT ,
if the file already exists it is an error and the
.B open
will fail.
.I See BUGS below, though.
.TP
.B O_NOCTTY
If
.I pathname
refers to a terminal device \(em see
.BR tty (4)
\(em it will not become the process's controlling terminal even if the
process does not have one.
.TP
.B O_TRUNC
If the file already exists it will be truncated.
.TP
.B O_APPEND
The file is opened in append mode. Initially, and before each
.BR write ,
the file pointer is positioned at the end of the file, as if
with
.BR lseek .
.TP
.BR O_NONBLOCK " or " O_NDELAY
The file is opened in non-blocking mode. Neither the
.B open
nor any subsequent operations on the file descriptor which is
returned will cause the calling process to wait.
.TP
.B O_SYNC
The file is opened for synchronous I/O. Any
.BR write s
on the resulting file descriptor will block the calling process until
the data has been physically written to the underlying hardware.
.I See BUGS below, though.
.PP
Some of these optional flags can be altered using
.B fcntl
after the file has been opened.

.I mode
specifies the permissions to use if a new file is created. It is
modified by the process's
.BR umask
in the usual way: the permissions of the created file are
.BR "(mode & ~umask)" .

.I mode
should always be specified when
.B O_CREAT
is in the
.IR flags ,
and is ignored otherwise.

.B creat
is equivalent to
.B open
with
.I flags
equal to
.BR O_CREAT|O_WRONLY|O_TRUNC .
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.BR open " and " creat
return the new file descriptor, or \-1 if an error occurred (in which case,
.I errno
is set appropriately).
.SH ERRORS
.TP
.B EEXIST
.I pathname
already exists and
.BR O_CREAT " and " O_EXCL
were used.
.TP
.B EISDIR
.I pathname
refers to a directory and the access requested involved writing.
.TP
.B ETXTBSY
.I pathname
refers to an executable image which is currently being executed and
write access was requested..
.TP
.B EFAULT
.IR pathname " points outside your accessible address space."
.TP
.B EACCES
The requested access to the file is not allowed, or one of the
directories in
.IR pathname
did not allow search (execute) permission.
.TP
.B ENAMETOOLONG
.IR pathname " was too long."
.TP
.B ENOENT
A directory component in
.I pathname
does not exist or is a dangling symbolic link.
.TP
.B ENOTDIR
A component used as a directory in
.I pathname
is not, in fact, a directory.
.TP
.B EMFILE
The process already has the maximum number of files open.
.TP
.B ENFILE
The limit on the total number of files open on the system has been
reached.
.TP
.B ENOMEM
Insufficient kernel memory was available.
.TP
.B EROFS
.I pathname
refers to a file on a read-only filesystem and write access was
requested.
.TP
.B ELOOP
.I pathname
contains a reference to a circular symbolic link, ie a symbolic link
whose expansion contains a reference to itself.
.TP
.B ENOSPC
.I pathname
was to be created but the device containing
.I pathname
has no room for the new file.

.SH BUGS
Currently (as of Linux 0.99pl7) all the normal filesystems sometime
allow the creation of two files in the same directory with the same
name. This occurs only rarely and only on a heavily loaded system. It
is believed that this bug is fixed in the Minix filesystem in Linux
0.99pl8 pre-release, and it is hoped that it will be fixed in the
other filesystems soon.

.B O_SYNC
is not currently implemented (as of Linux 0.99pl7).

There are many infelicities in the protocol underlying NFS, affecting
amongst others
.BR O_SYNC ", " O_EXCL ", " O_NDELAY " and " O_APPEND .
