.TH LISTEN 2 "23 July 1993" "BSD Man Page" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
listen \- listen for connections on a socket
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <sys/socket.h>
.sp
.BI "int listen(int " s ", int " backlog );
.SH DESCRIPTION
To accept connections, a socket is first created with
.BR socket (2),
a willingness to accept incoming connections and a queue limit for incoming
connections are specified with
.BR listen ,
and then the connections are
accepted with
.BR accept (2).
The
.B listen
call applies only to sockets of type
.B SOCK_STREAM
or
.B SOCK_SEQPACKET.

The
.I backlog
parameter defines the maximum length the queue of pending connections may
grow to.  If a connection request arrives with the queue full the client
may receive an error with an indication of
.BR ECONNREFUSED ,
or, if the underlying protocol supports retransmission, the request may be
ignored so that retries may succeed.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 0.8i
.B EBADF
The argument
.I s
is not a valid descriptor.
.TP
.B ENOTSOCK
The argument
.I s
is not a socket.
.TP
.B EOPNOTSUPP
The socket is not of a type that supports the operation
.BR listen .
.SH HISTORY
The
.B listen
function call appeared in BSD 4.2.
.SH BUGS
The
.I backlog
is currently limited (silently) to 5. [Documenter's note: is this true for
Linux?]
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR accept "(2), " connect "(2), " socket (2)
