.SH DESCRIPTION
The function performs the control operation specified by
.I cmd
on the message queue with identifier
.IR msqid .
Legal values for
.I cmd
are:
.TP 12
.B IPC_STAT
Copy info from the message queue data structure
into the structure pointed to by
.IR buf .
The user must have read access priviledges on the message queue.
.TP
.B IPC_SET
Write the values of some members of the
.B msqid_ds
structure pointed to by
.I buf
to the message queue data structure, updating also its
.B msg_ctime
member.
Considered members from the user supplied
.B "struct msqid_ds"
pointed to by
.I buf
are
.nf
.sp
.ft B
	msg_perm.uid
	msg_perm.gid
	msg_perm.mode	\fR/* only lowest 9-bits */\fP
	msg_qbytes
.fi
.ft R
.sp
The calling process effective user\-ID must be one among super\-user,
creator or owner of the message queue.
Only the super\-user can raise the
.B msg_qbytes
value beyond the system parameter
.BR MSGMNB .
.TP
.B IPC_RMID
Remove immediatly the message queue and its data structures
awakening all waiting reader and writer processess (with an error
return and
.B errno
set to
.BR EIDRM ).
The calling process effective user\-ID must be one among super\-user,
creator or owner of the message queue.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
If successful, the return value will be
.BR 0 ,
otherwise
.B \-1
with
.B errno
indicating the error.
.SH ERRORS
For a failing return,
.B errno
will be set to one among the following values:
.TP 11
.B EACCESS
The argument
.I cmd
is equal to
.B IPC_STAT
but the calling process has no read access permissions on the message queue
.IR msqid .
.TP
.B EFAULT
The argument
.I cmd
has value
.B IPC_SET
or
.B IPC_STAT
but the address pointed to by
.I buf
isn't accessible.
.TP
.B EIDRM
The message queue was removed.
.TP
.B EINVAL
Invalid value for
.I cmd
or
.IR msqid .
.TP
.B EPERM
The argument
.I cmd
has value
.B IPC_SET
or
.B IPC_RMID
but the calling process effective user\-ID has insufficient
priviledges to execute the command.
Note this is also the case of a non super\-user process
trying to increase the
.B msg_qbytes
value beyond the value specified by the system parameter
.BR MSGMNB .
.SH NOTES
The
.BR IPC_INFO ,
.BR MSG_STAT
and
.B MSG_INFO
control calls are used by the
.BR ipcs (1)
program to provide information on allocated resources.
In the future these can be modified as needed or moved to a proc file system
interface.
