.TH SIGBLOCK 2 "24 July 1993" "BSD Man Page" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sigblock, sigmask \- block signals
.SH SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <signal.h>
.sp
.BI "int sigblock(int " mask );
..br
.BI "int sigmask( " signum );
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This interface is made obsolete by:
.BR sigprocmask (2).

.B Sigblock
adds the signals specified in
.I mask
to the set of signals currently being blocked from delivery.  Signals are
blocked if the corresponding bit in
.I mask
is a 1; the macro
.B sigmask
is provided to construct the mask for a given
.IR signum .

It is not possible to block
.B SIGKILL
or
.B SIGSTOP ;
this restriction is silently imposed by the system.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
The previous set of masked signals is returned.
.Sh HISTORY
These function calls appeared in BSD 4.3 and have been deprecated.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR kill "(2), " sigprocmask "(2), " sigsetmask "(2), " siggetops (3)
