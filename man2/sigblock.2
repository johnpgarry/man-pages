.TH SIGBLOCK 2 "11 August 1995" "BSD Man Page" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
sigblock, siggetmask, sigsetmask, sigmask \- manipulate the signal mask
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <signal.h>
.sp
.BI "int sigblock(int " mask );
.br
.B int siggetmask(void);
.br
.BI "int sigsetmask(int " mask );
.br
.BI "int sigmask(" signum );
.SH DESCRIPTION
This interface is made obsolete by:
.BR sigprocmask (2).

.B Sigblock()
adds the signals specified in
.I mask
to the set of signals currently being blocked from delivery.

.B sigsetmask()
replaces the set of blocked signals totally with a new set specified in
.IR mask .

Signals are blocked if the corresponding bit in
.I mask
is a 1; the macro
.B sigmask
is provided to construct the mask for a given
.IR signum .

It is not possible to block
.B SIGKILL
or
.BR SIGSTOP ;
this restriction is silently imposed by the system.

The current set of blocked signals can be obtained using
.BR siggetmask() .
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.B Siggetmask()
returns the current set of masked signals.

.B Sigsetmask() 
and
.B sigblock()
return the previous set of masked signals.
.SH HISTORY
These function calls appeared in BSD 4.3 and have been deprecated.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR kill "(2), " sigprocmask "(2), " siggetops (3)
