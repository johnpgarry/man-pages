.SH SYNOPSIS
None.
.SH DESCRIPTION
As of Linux 0.99.11, there were 123 system calls listed in
.IR /usr/include/sys/syscall.h .
This man pages mentions those calls which are not documented.  Some of
these calls did not appear to have prototypes in the DLL 4.4.1 include
files, or did not exist in the kernel.

Since this situation is probably going to change with future kernels,
please look in the kernel source code, write a man page (using a style
similar to that of the other Linux section 2 man pages), and send it to
.B faith@cs.unc.edu
for inclusion in the next man page release from the Linux Documentation
Project.
.SH BUGS
Old-style system calls (i.e.,
.BR oldstat " and " oldolduname
are not listed here.

None of the System V IPC functions are enumerated here, or have their own
pointers to this page.  Although these functions are now in the kernel,
they have yet to be documented in man page format.  A texinfo manual,
however, does exist for them.
