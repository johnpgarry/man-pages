.SH NAME
nice \- change process priority
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int nice(int " inc );
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B nice
adds 
.I inc
to the priority for the calling pid.  Note that only the superuser may
specify a negative increment, or priority increase.  Note that internally,
a higher number is a higher priority.  Do not confuse this with the
priority scheme as used by the
.B  nice
interface.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, -1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH ERRORS
.TP 0.8i
.B EPERM
A non-super user attempts to do a priority increase, a numerical
decrease, by supplying a negative
.IR inc .
