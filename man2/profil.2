.TH PROFIL 2 "23 July 1993" "Linux 0.99.11" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
profil \- execution time profile
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include <unistd.h>
.sp
.BI "int profil(char *" buf ", int " bufsiz ", int " offset ", int " scale );
.SH DESCRIPTION
Under Linux 0.99.11,
.I profil
is not implemented in the kernel.  Instead, the DLL 4.4.1 libraries provide
a user-space implementation.

.I Buf
points to
.I bufsiz
bytes of core.  Every virtual microsecond, the user's program counter (PC)
is examined:
.I offset
is subtracted and the result is multiplied by
.IR scale .
If this address is in
.IR buf ,
then the word pointed to is incremented.

If
.I scale
is less than 2 or
.I bufsiz
is zero, profiling is disabled.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Zero is always returned.
.SH BUGS
.I profil
cannot be used on a program that also uses
.B ITIMER_PROF
itimers.

Calling
.B profil
with an invalid
.I buf
will result in a core dump.

True kernel profiling provides more accurate results.
