.TH PHYS 2 "24 July 1993" "Linux 0.99.11" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
phys \- allow a process to access physical addresses [NOT IMPLEMENTED]
.SH SYNOPSIS
.ad l
.nf
.BI "int phys(int " physnum ", char *" virtaddr ", long " size ,
.BI "char *" physaddr );
.fi
.ad b
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR WARNING :
Since this function is not implemented as of Linux 0.99.11, it will always
return \-1 and set
.I errno
to
.BR ENOSYS .

\fBphys\fP maps arbitrary physical memory into a process's virtual
address space.  \fIphysnum\fP is  number (0\(en3) that specifies which
of the 4 physical spaces to set up.  Up to 4 \fBphys\fP calls can be
active at any one time.  \fIvirtaddr\fP is the process's virtual address.
\fIsize\fP is the number of bytes to map in.  \fIphysaddr\fP is the
physical address to map in.
.PP
Valid \fIvirtaddr\fP and \fIphysaddr\fP values are constrained by
hardware and must be at an address multiple of the resolution of the
CPU's memory management scheme.  If \fIsize\fP is non zero, \fIsize\fP
is rounded up to the next MMU resolution boundary.  If \fIsize\fP is
zero, any previous \fBphys\fP(2) mapping for that \fIphysnum\fP is
nullified.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
On success, zero is returned.  On error, \-1 is returned, and
.I errno
is set appropriately.
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
v7
.SH BUGS
\fBphys\fP is very machine dependent.
